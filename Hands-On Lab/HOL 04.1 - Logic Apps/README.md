Create your first logic app workflow to automate processes between cloud
apps and cloud services

Without writing any code, you can automate business processes more
easily and quickly when you create and run workflows with *Azure Logic
Apps*. This first example shows how to create a basic logic app workflow
that checks an RSS feed for new content on a website. When new items
appear in the website's feed, the logic app sends email from an Outlook
or Gmail account.

Also, this example requires these items:

-   An Outlook.com, Office 365 Outlook, or Gmail account

> Tip
>
> If you have a personal [*Microsoft
> account*](https://account.microsoft.com/account), you have an
> Outlook.com account. Otherwise, if you have an Azure work or school
> account, you have an **Office 365 Outlook** account.

-   A link to a website's RSS feed. This example uses the [*RSS feed for
    > top stories from the CNN.com
    > website*](http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss):http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn\_topstories.rss

Add a trigger that starts your workflow

A [*trigger*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps#logic-app-concepts) is
an event that starts your logic app workflow and is the first item that
your logic app needs.

1.  Sign in to the [*Azure portal*](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  From the left menu, choose **New** &gt; **Enterprise
    > Integration** &gt; **Logic App** as shown here:

> <img src="./media/image1.png" width="558" height="321" />
>
> Tip
>
> You can also choose **New**, then in the search box, type logic app,
> and press Enter. Then choose **Logic App** &gt; **Create**.

1.  Name your logic app and select your Azure subscription. Now create
    > or select an Azure resource group, which helps you organize and
    > manage related Azure resources. Finally, select the datacenter
    > location for hosting your logic app. When you're ready,
    > choose **Pin to dashboard** and then **Create**.

> <img src="./media/image2.png" width="320" height="500" />
>
> Note
>
> When you select **Pin to dashboard**, your logic app appears on the
> Azure dashboard after deployment, and opens automatically. If your
> logic app doesn't appear on the dashboard, on the **All
> resources** tile, choose **See More**, and select your logic app. Or
> on the left menu, choose **More services**. Under **Enterprise
> Integration**, choose **Logic Apps**, and select your logic app.

1.  When you open your logic app for the first time, the Logic App
    > Designer shows templates that you can use to get started. For now,
    > choose **Blank Logic App** so you can build your logic app
    > from scratch.

> The Logic App Designer opens and shows available services
> and *triggers* that you can use in your logic app.

1.  In the search box, type RSS, and select this trigger: **RSS - When a
    > feed item is published**

> <img src="./media/image3.png" width="469" height="310" />

1.  Enter the link for the website's RSS feed that you want to track.

> You can also change **Frequency** and **Interval**. These settings
> determine how often your logic app checks for new items and returns
> all items found during that time span.
>
> For this example, let's check every day for top stories posted to the
> CNN website.
>
> <img src="./media/image4.png" width="469" height="310" />

1.  Save your work for now. (On the designer command bar,
    > choose **Save**.)

> <img src="./media/image5.png" width="500" height="419" />
>
> When you save, your logic app goes live, but currently, your logic app
> only checks for new items in the specified RSS feed. To make this
> example more useful, we add an action that your logic app performs
> after your trigger fires.

Add an action that responds to your trigger

An *action* is a task performed by your logic app workflow. After you
add a trigger to your logic app, you can add an action to perform
operations with data generated by that trigger. For our example, we now
add an action that sends email when new items appear in the website's
RSS feed.

1.  In the designer, under your trigger, choose **New step** &gt; **Add
    > an action** as shown here:

> <img src="./media/image6.png" width="469" height="229" />
>
> The designer shows *available connectors* so that you can select an
> action to perform when your trigger fires.

1.  Based on your email account, follow the steps for Outlook or Gmail.

    -   To send email from your Outlook account, in the search
        > box, enter outlook. Under **Services**,
        > choose **Outlook.com** for personal Microsoft accounts, or
        > choose **Office 365 Outlook** for Azure work or
        > school accounts. Under **Actions**, select **Send an email**.

> <img src="./media/image7.png" width="469" height="500" />

-   To send email from your Gmail account, in the search
    > box, enter gmail. Under **Actions**, select **Send email**.

> <img src="./media/image8.png" width="469" height="459" />

1.  When you're prompted for credentials, sign in with the username and
    > password for your email account.

2.  Provide the details for this action, like the destination email
    > address, and choose the parameters for the data to include in the
    > email, for example:

> <img src="./media/image9.png" width="469" height="469" />
>
> So if you chose Outlook, your logic app might look like this example:
>
> <img src="./media/image10.png" width="500" height="1000" />

1.  Save your changes. (On the designer command bar, choose **Save**.)

2.  You can now manually run your logic app for testing. On the designer
    > command bar, choose **Run**. Otherwise, you can let your logic app
    > check the specified RSS feed based on the schedule that you
    > set up.

> If your logic app finds new items, the logic app sends email that
> includes your selected data. If no new items are found, your logic app
> skips the action that sends email.

1.  To monitor and check your logic app's run and trigger history, on
    > your logic app menu, choose **Overview**.

> <img src="./media/image11.png" width="571" height="380" />
>
> Tip
>
> If you don't find the data that you expect, on the command bar, try
> choosing **Refresh**.
>
> To learn more about your logic app's status or run and trigger
> history, or to diagnose your logic app, see [*Troubleshoot your logic
> app*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-diagnosing-failures).
>
> Note
>
> Your logic app continues running until you turn off your app. To turn
> off your app for now, on your logic app menu, choose **Overview**. On
> the command bar, choose **Disable**.

Congratulations, you just set up and run your first basic logic app. You
also learned how easily you can create workflows that automate
processes, and integrate cloud apps and cloud services - all without
code.

Manage your logic app

To manage your app, you can perform tasks like check the status, edit,
view history, turn off, or delete your logic app.

1.  Sign in to the [*Azure portal*](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  On the left menu, choose **More services**. Under **Enterprise
    > Integration**, choose **Logic Apps**. Select your logic app.

> In the logic app menu, you can find these logic app management tasks:
