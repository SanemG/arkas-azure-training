# Lab: Azure App Service

In this  lab, you will create three **Azure App Services**: one to host a
public-facing web site, one to host a web API to be consumed by mobile applications,
and one to host a management web site. Each of these three Azure App Service,
instances will all use the same **App Service Plan**, meaning they share the same
compute resources.

### Step 1: Create a Resource Group

Anything you create in Azure must belong to a Resource Group. You can group your
resources however you likeâ€”there's nothing stopping you putting every Azure
service you want to use in its own Resource Group. However, if your
subscription hosts multiple services, you would generally group related Azure resources
together. For example, if you have a web site that requires a Redis Cache instance,
you would typically put the Azure Web App that hosts the site in the same resource
group as the Redis Cache. Everything you create in Azure during these labs will
go into the same Resource Group.

You can delete all of the resources in a Resource Group in a single operation,
making it easy to clear things up once you're finished with these labs. It is
also possible to deploy all of the Azure resources in a Resource Group in a
single step by defining a resource template, as you'll see if you complete
the second part of this lab.

1. Open the **Azure Portal** ([https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/))
   in a web browser. Log in using an account that has access to the Azure
   subscription you will be using.

2. On the left-hand side, you will see various labeled icons. (It's possible to
   expand and collapse the labels by clicking the ![Hamburger menu](media/AzurePortalHamburger.png) icon,
   so you might see only the icons.) Near the top of this will be a
   **Resource groups** entry.

   ![New button in Azure Portal](media/AzurePortalResourceGroupsButton.png)

   Click it.

3. This opens the **Resource groups** "blade." A blade is a panel in the Azure
   portal that serves some particular purpose, such as managing a Resource Group
   or configuring a web site. As you will see, blades stack horizontally across
   the screen as you navigate through the portal. Near the top you will see an
   **Add** button.

   ![Add resource group button](media/AzurePortalAddResourceGroupButton.png)

   Click this button.

4. The portal replaces the **Resource groups** blade with a **Resource group**
   blade in which you can enter the details for a new Resource Group.

   ![Create resource group](media/CreateResourceGroup.png)

   You must provide a name, which must be unique within your subscription.
   We suggest **AzureKit** but you can use any name.

   If you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions you will be required to
   choose the one in which you want to create this Resource Group. You
   must also specify the geographic location to use. (This determines only the default
   location for new resources - a Resource Group can contain resources spread
   across multiple regions.)

   **Note:** Not all Azure services are available in all regions. You can
   find a complete, up to date list of what is available where at
   [https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/)


5. Near the bottom of the blade, select the **Pin to dashboard** checkbox, then
   click the **Create** button.

   ![Pin to dashboard checkbox, and create button](media/PinToDashboardAndCreate.png)

6. You might briefly see the background of the Azure portal appear, with a message
   indicating that creation is in progress. Shortly afterwards, you will see
   a blade representing your new resource group, which will currently be empty.

   ![New, empty resource group](media/NewEmptyResourceGroup.png)

7. Because you checked the checkbox asking to pin your Resource Group to your
   dashboard, it will always be easy to return to this blade after performing other
   tasks in the portal. Simply click the **Microsoft Azure** text at the top left of
   the portal, which will close any open blades and show the dashboard. You
   will then see a tile on the dashboard representing your Resource Group.

   ![Resource group shown on Azure portal dashboard](media/EmptyResourceGroupOnDashboard.png)

   **Note:** Although tiles on the dashboard representing a Resource Group generally
   show the resources it contains, the tile does not always update immediately. So, as
   you work through the labs, do not be surprised if you do not see a newly-created
   resource in this tile. If you click on the tile to open the Resource Group's blade,
   you will see an up-to-date list.

Now that you have created a Resource Group, you can create the resources required to
host the various web sites and APIs in the Azure Kit.


### Step 2: Create App for the Main Web Site

In this part, you will use Azure's App Service feature to host the kit's main web site.
(Azure App Service also has features designed to help with hosting web APIs, and
provides various services useful if you are writing backends for mobile apps. 
It also offers *Logic Apps*, which are workflow-based operations. We'll see some of
these features in later labs; for now we're just using the basic web site hosting
capabilities.)

1. Near the top left of the Azure Portal, click the **+ New** entry.

   ![New](media/AzurePortalNew.png)

   (If you have collapsed these items, you'll just see the **+** symbol.)

2. In the **Marketplace** list that appears, select **Web + Mobile**.

   ![Web and mobile](media/AzurePortalMarketplaceWebAndMobile.png)

3. In the **Feature Apps** list that opens, select **Web App**.

   ![Web App](media/AzurePortalMarketplaceWebApp.png)

4. The portal will show a **Web App** blade for entering details about
   your new app.

   ![New Web App details](media/NewWebApp.png)

   You must enter a name, which needs to be globally unique - this name will form
   part of the hostname for your web site. Azure will append `.azurewebsites.net`
   to whatever name you use, so you can't use a name that anyone else has already
   chosen for an Azure Web App. This doesn't need to be the name users
   will see; you can configure a Web App to use any name in any DNS domain that you
   control, but the Web App will always also be accessible through the name you
   choose here.

   If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, you will need to choose the one you
   wish to use.

   Under **Resource Group**, you should choose the one you created earlier.

   The **App Service plan/Location** determines the compute resources that will be
   used to host your site. Click on this, and it will show the following:

   ![App Service plan selection blade](media/CreateNewAppServicePlan.png)

   If you already have one or more service plans in your subscription, they will
   appear here. Whether you do or don't, we'll be creating a new plan, so click
   **Create New**. This blade will appear.

   ![New App Service Plan configuration page](media/NewAppServicePlan.png)

   This is where you configure the new plan. In this case, the name need only be
   unique within your Azure subscription. The location should be wherever you want
   to host the Web App (the same as you chose for your Resource Group).
   
   The **Pricing tier** determines whether your plan will share compute resources with
   other Azure users, or will get its own dedicated CPU core(s) and memory. If
   you click this item, and then click **View all** to see all available tiers, you
   will see a wide price range. There is a *Free* option, which will be enough to get
   started, but performance won't be great. The *Shared* option also shares compute
   resource with others but provides additional functionality such as the ability to
   use a custom domain name. (Free web sites only get to use the `.azurewebsites.net`
   name.) The *Basic*, *Standard*, and *Premium* options all provide dedicated compute
   resources, each in either 1-, 2-, or 4-core configurations. You can also
   scale out to multiple machines, to a maximum of 20 instances (80 cores if you
   choose the largest instance size) if you select *Premium*. *Standard* and *Basic*
   scale out to 10 and 3 instances respectively.

   **Note:** If you plan to do the Traffic Manager lab in which you deploy web
   apps to multiple geographic regions and arrange for end users to communicate with
   whichever happens to be nearest, you will need to select either *Standard* or
   *Premium* because this feature is not available on *Basic*, *Shared*, or *Free*.

   Once you've chosen a pricing tier, click the **Select** button. Then, in the
   **New App Service Plan** blade, click **OK**. Finally, in the **Web App** blade,
   click **Create**. (You do not need to pin this item to the dashboard. You can
   if you want, but you'll be able to get to this Web App through the tile for
   your Resource Group, which is already pinned to the dashboard.)

 5. The Azure portal will create your new Web App. You can watch its progress by
    clicking the bell icon near the top right of the browser window.

    ![Deployment started message](media/PortalMessageDeploymentInProgress.png)

    The Azure portal shows messages here. You will see information about recently
    created items, such as your Resource Group. Once it has finished creating the
    Web App, the message will change to show that it succeeded.

    ![Deployment succeeded message](media/PortalMessageDeploymentSucceeded.png)

    Your Web App now exists, but you haven't deployed anything to it; if you were
    to look at it, you'd see only a placeholder page. So, next, you will need to deploy
    the web site.

### Step 3: Publish from Visual Studio

1. Run **Visual Studio 2015**.

2. Select the **File | Open | Project/Solution** menu item (or type **Ctrl+Shift+O**).
   Find the `src\AzureKit` folder in the location where you cloned the repository from GitHub. Open the
   `AzureKit - Server Only.sln` solution file.

3. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on the **AzureKit** project. Select **Publish**.
   The **Publish** dialog opens.

   ![Publish dialog](media/PublishDialogFirstTime.png)

4. Select **Microsoft Azure App Service**. The **App Service** dialog opens.

   ![App Service selector](media/ChooseAppService.png)

   If you have access to multiple subscriptions, ensure that you have selected the one
   you are using. Also, select **Resource Group** under **View**. Visual Studio will
   search your Azure Subscription for App Services. This may take a few seconds, but
   you should eventually see your Resource Group. If you expand it, you should see
   your Web App. Select your Web App then click **OK**.

   The **Publish** dialog will now show its **Connection** page.

   ![Publish dialog - connection](media/PublishDialogConnection.png)

5. You do not need to change any of the default settings Visual Studio chose, so
   click **Publish**. Visual Studio will build the project and then deploy it to
   Azure. (This can take a few minutes the first time you do it.) Once deployment
   is complete, Visual Studio will show your site in a web browser.
